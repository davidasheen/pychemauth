PyChemAuth contains both original code and wrappers around other libraries and thus relies on contributions from many other sources.  
If you use these tools be sure to cite the original authors.

Code

If you use UMAP refer to the authors' `github repo <https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap>`_ for information about citation.  
At the very least, you should cite the manuscript associated with the software itself:

.. code-block:: bibtex

   @article{mcinnes2018umap-software,
   title={UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection},
   author={McInnes, Leland and Healy, John and Saul, Nathaniel and Grossberger, Lukas},
   journal={The Journal of Open Source Software},
   volume={3},
   number={29},
   pages={861},
   year={2018}
   }

If you use `PyOD <https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ be sure to cite:

.. code-block:: bibtex
    
   @article{zhao2019pyod,
   author  = {Zhao, Yue and Nasrullah, Zain and Li, Zheng},
   title   = {PyOD: A Python Toolbox for Scalable Outlier Detection},
   journal = {Journal of Machine Learning Research},
   year    = {2019},
   volume  = {20},
   number  = {96},
   pages   = {1-7},
   url     = {http://jmlr.org/papers/v20/19-011.html}
   }

Refer to several citations for `SHAP <https://github.com/slundberg/shap>`_ on the authors' website, but at a minimum be sure to cite:

.. code-block:: bibtex
    
   @incollection{NIPS2017_7062,
   title = {A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions},
   author = {Lundberg, Scott M and Lee, Su-In},
   booktitle = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 30},
   editor = {I. Guyon and U. V. Luxburg and S. Bengio and H. Wallach and R. Fergus and S. Vishwanathan and R. Garnett},
   pages = {4765--4774},
   year = {2017},
   publisher = {Curran Associates, Inc.},
   url = {http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions.pdf}
   }


The `imbalanced-learn <https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/index.html>`_ package should be cited as:

.. code-block:: bibtex
   
   @article{JMLR:v18:16-365,
   author  = {Guillaume  Lema{{\^i}}tre and Fernando Nogueira and Christos K. Aridas},
   title   = {Imbalanced-learn: A Python Toolbox to Tackle the Curse of Imbalanced Datasets in Machine Learning},

   year    = {2017},
   volume  = {18},
   number  = {17},
   pages   = {1-5},
   url     = {http://jmlr.org/papers/v18/16-365.html}
   }
