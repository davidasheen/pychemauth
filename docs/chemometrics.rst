==============================

Many `conventional chemometric tools <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00401706.1993.10485033>`_ are based on statistical data models.  These include PLS, PCR, and PCA.  Here, we review some of the mathematics behind these tools and give example implementations in python to improve one's intuition behind these methods.
