This \"open set\" of possibilities means that a classifier should be able to recognize the known classes seen during training, but also recognize when a test case is \"none of the above.\"  There are a variety of algorithms designed to do this and related tasks.  Here a few references that summarize some ontologies:\n",

    "The \"open set recognition\" (OSR) task refers to when the model should be able to identify known classes and reject unknown ones.  By some classification schemes, the process of simply rejecting an input as being from an unknown class is referred to as a \"reject\" option.  OSR tasks are closely related to one-class classifiers (OCC) used for authentication purposes.  An OSR-capable model can be constructed by chaining together multiple OCCs, each designed to recognize a single class.  [Soft PLS-DA](../learn/plsda.ipynb) is another example of model capable of handling open-set conditions. Another *ad hoc*, but general, way to handle an OSR task is to combine an outlier detector with a closed set classifier. Green and red pathways illustrate [\"compliant\" and \"rigorous\"](simca.ipynb#Building-an-Authenticator) OCC training schemes, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../_static/osr.png\" style=\"width:250px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The outlier detector illustrated here determines if a sample is out of distribution (OOD), and sends only those in distribution (ID) to the classifier.  In this way, the outlier detector determines if the input is coming from a \"known\" region of parameter space which the classifier should be responsible for.  If not, the input is simply assigned to an \"unknown\" class.  Otherwise, the closed-set classifier is assumed to be responsible for identifying the input as one of its known classes.  The outlier detector itself may use a variety of different assumptions depending on which detector is used, as may the classifier, but this combination method is very general and can be applied with different sorts of outlier detectors and classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have implemented a basic OpenSetClassification model in PyChemAuth which we illustrate for a variety of different conditions below. Depending on the classification model being used the performance metric may vary.  Moreover, if the underlying model si capable of detecting outliers (or rejecting acceptance as in OCC) we should combine those (1) rejected because the test sample belongs to an known alternative (\"known unknown\") with those (2) rejected because they are from an unknown alternative class (\"unknown unknown\") to compute the correct performance metric."
