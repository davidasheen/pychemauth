Chemometric Carpentry
==============================

An introductory course to chemometrics in python, which relies heavily on PyChemAuth and illustrates its use, can be found [here]('https://github.com/mahynski/chemometric-carpentry').

"The goal of this short course is to introduce and explain elementary chemometric analysis methods. We will also touch on more advanced ML approaches. The course will cover the use of python-based tools that can accelerate your workflow and improve reproducibility. We will assume no prior knowledge or familiarity with any of these methods, tools, or mathematical background. We will review only as much mathematics as is necessary to ground an understanding of the methods discussed since a deep understanding is not necessary for application, which is the focus of this course."
